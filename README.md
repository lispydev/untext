# Pyde

Pyde is a textless Python IDE built in Python.

Unlike other IDEs, pyde does not include a text editor, and goes straigth to theAST layer for syntax-aware editing.

Pyde uses a webview to render the UI from Python, with css to bridge the gap between AST attributes and readable code on the screen.
