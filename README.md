# Untext

Untext is a textless Python *interactive* development environment built in Python.

Unlike other IDEs, untext does not include a text editor, and goes straigth to the AST layer for syntax-aware editing capabilities.

Untext uses a webview to render the UI from Python, with css to bridge the gap between AST attributes and readable code on the screen.
